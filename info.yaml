  title:        "Tiny Tapeout GF180 – Multiplier with FA Targets"
  author:       "Louis Ledoux"
  discord:      "Binaryman#9502"
  description:  "Streams 8-bit chunks into two 24-bit operands and exposes a replicated product-nonzero flag."
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     50000000       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 340x160 uM.
  tiles: "2x2"          # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 3x4 or 4x4

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_binaryman_multfa"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
